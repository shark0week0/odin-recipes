    <h1>Cheesecake Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake. Online recipes like to warn you to be careful of the surface cracking, but my old and crappy oven didn't seem to have a problem. The water bath does most of the work. The springform pan is also an amazing invention.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, this was a pretty easy recipe. I wasn't prepared for how rich it ended up being, though, so if I were to do it again, I'd use a smaller pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the crust:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>18 graham crackers</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 stick butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 lbs cream cheese (ROOM TEMPERATURE!!!)</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sourcream</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juiice</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 whole eggs &amp; 2 yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces raspberries</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Crust:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325&deg; F.</li>
        <li>Sppray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Process crackers into dust. Add sugar and butter, then mix until moistened.</li>
        <li>Press cracker mixture into pan, making sure it comes one inch up the sides.</li>
        <li>Bake 12 minutes or until slightly browned. Pull out of oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom and outside of the pan with foil. This is a barrier to keep the water out.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat room temperature cream cheese until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and sugar, then beat until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla. Beat to combine.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and yolks, one at a time. Beat to combine. Mixture should turn slight yellow color.</li>
     </ol>
     <h4>Baking:</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Pour filling mixture into pan until it just covers the crust.</li>
        <li>Put foil-covered pan into roasting pan. Fill up the roasting pan with boiling (212&deg; F) water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cheescake.</li>
        <li>Bake 1 1/2 hours then turn off oven and open the door a crack. Let sit 1 hour, then ttake out and put into fridge for at least 6 hours.</li>
     </ol>
     <h4>Finish:</h4>
     <ol>
         <li>In a small saucepan, combine raspberries, lemon juice, and sugar. Add lemon zest (optional).</li>
         <li>Heat over medium heat until simmering.</li>
         <li>Remove from heat and puree until smooth. Run through strainer until seeds are gone and mixture is smooth.</li>
         <li>Let topping cool before putting on cheesecake.</li>
         <li>Decorate according to your tastes. Rustic (messy) is in style nowadays.</li>
         <li>Cut yourself a slice and <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
     </ol>
