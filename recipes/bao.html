    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I still haven't really figured out how to keep the buns closed after steaming.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>Bottle of char siu sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix sauce and pork until combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, yeast. Let sit 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of flour at a time, mixing with rest of ingredients.</li>
        <li>Knead until smooth. Cover, let rise 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down, let sit 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide into 10 balls. Roll each ball into 5-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Place spoon of filling in middle of circle. Bring up sides of dough, pinching and sealing with a twist.</li>
        <li>Repeat for rest of balls.</li>
     </ol>
     <h4>Steam:</h4>
     <ol>
         <li>Arrange buns on parchment paper in bamboo steamer.</li>
         <li>Add water to skillet (make sure water will not reach buns once steamer is placed inside) and bring to boil.</li>
         <li>Steam 15 minutes, then shut off heat and let cool 10 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE STEAMER.</li>
         <li>Once it's had time to finish cooking, open steamer and serve still warm.</li>
     </ol>
